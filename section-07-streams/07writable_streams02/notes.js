// Backpressure and Internal Buffer of writable Streams

//     Read speed is fast of HardDisks and SSD as compared to write speed.
//     writeStream.writableLength -> How much data is loaded on its internal buffer.

//     It can load data more than HighWaterMark value.

//     writeStream.write() return boolean value. True if it has writableLength lessthan to HighWaterMark value, else false.

//     writeStream.on("drain") -> This event fires when the data is written and buffer is ready to load new data.

//     Backpressure occurs when a Writable stream cannot process incoming data as fast as it’s being written to it.

//     Why Does Backpressure Happen?
//         Writable streams have an internal buffer. If you write too much data too quickly.
//         The buffer fills up.
//         The stream pauses or slows down incoming writes.
//         You must wait before writing more.
    
//     Eg.
    function writeMany(writer, data, count) {
        let i = 0;
        function write() {
            while (i < count) {
            const ok = writer.write(data);
            i++;
            if (!ok) {
                writer.once('drain', write);
                return;
            }
            }
            writer.end();
