// Internal Buffer of Readable Stream

//     The chunks that we recieve till the stream is ended is called as internal buffer.

//     Every time this internal buffer changes with every chunk.
//     Internal Buffer size is equivalent to highWaterMark.

//     stream.on("readable", () => {
//         console.log(stream.readableLength);
//         console.log(stream.read());
//         console.log(stream.readableLength);
//     });

//     Here we are listening for readable event, when it fires.
//     It will show how much bytes of data is coming in chunk
//     `strem.read()` will read the data.
//     It will show remaining bytes of data in chunk.
