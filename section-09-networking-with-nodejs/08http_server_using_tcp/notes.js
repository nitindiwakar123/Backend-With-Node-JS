// HTTP Server using Net Module

//     Browser only understand a HTTP response, which is behind the scene a TCP request.

//     Chrome Brwoser expects for "HTTP\n\n" is reponse.
//     but in case of firefox it doesn't require.

//     But the correct syntax of writing it is:
//     socket.end("HTTP/1.1\n\nHello World");

//     If the given HTTP version is not available it will fallback to default version

//     Browsers are capable of understanding and handling streams.

//     Chrome downloads the video, but firefox plays it.
