// ==========================================
// Types of Modules in Node.js (Theory Only)
// ==========================================

/*
1. Built-in / Core / Native Modules
---------------------
- These modules are provided by Node.js itself.
- No need to install them separately.
- Common examples include: fs, http, path, os, etc.
- They are used for core functionalities like file system operations, creating servers, etc.
*/


/*
2. Local / User Defined Modules
------------------
- These are custom modules created by the developer.
- They help in organizing code into reusable components.
- You can create your own files and export functions, objects, or classes from them.
- These modules are imported using a relative path (e.g., './math.js').
*/


/*
3. Third-party Modules
------------------------
- These are external packages developed by the community.
- They are installed using npm (Node Package Manager).
- Provide extended functionality like web frameworks, color styling, utility functions, etc.
- Examples: express, chalk, mongoose, lodash, etc.
