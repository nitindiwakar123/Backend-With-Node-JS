// Alloc Vs AllocUnsafe 

// 	If we create an buffer from this 2 methods, they are same but the arrayBuffer they use behind the scenes is were the changes comes.

// 	if we create a buffer of 10000 Bytes,
// 	using Buffer.alloc() method ensure that it will give empty space with zero place holder value.
// 	using Buffer.allocUnsafe() method doesn't ensure that the given space will be empty only.

// 	So using allocUnsafe() can be risky since it can reveal some sensitive information. But it is fast as compared to alloc()

// 	we should only use allocUnsafe when we want to fill the data immediately
