// Reading and writing a buffer
	
// 	for reading arrayBuffer content we need to create an another object.
// 	Dataview is a constructor function it require arrayBuffer as firt argument.
// 	It gives a bunch of methods for setting and getting the data in buffer.
	
// 	Ex: view.setInt8(1, 70)

// 	The setInt8 method takes index and the data to write as argument

// 	What is byteOffset ?
// 		It means how much byteControl the DataView has.
// 		It take second argument for byteOffset, bydefault it is 0.
//      const view = new DataView(arrayBuffer, byteOffset).
	
// 	for reading data we use .getInt8(index) this reads as signed value
	
// 	.getUint8(index) this reads as Unsigned value.
