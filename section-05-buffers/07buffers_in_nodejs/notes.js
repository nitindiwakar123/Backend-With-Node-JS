// Buffer in NodeJS

// 	It is just a typedArray of Uint8array, which has extra properties and methods provided by NodeJS
// 	We globally get access of Buffer keyword in NodeJS, but not in browser
// 	Using Buffer with `new Buffer()` is deprecated for security reasons
// 	If we are not getting suggestion of methods and properties, we can do 2 things: `import {Buffer} from 'buffer'` OR `npm i @types/node -D`
// 	But Node JS Suggest the importing way

// 	Buffer.alloc(size) -> Creates an empty Buffer of give size
// 	behind the scenes it take given size bytes only for array buffer

// 	Buffer.from(ArrayBuffer) -> Creates buffer
// 	behind the scenes it take more size of byte than require.

// 	Uint8Array .toString() Method doesn't provide the actual data
// 	Buffer .toString() Method provide the actual data
