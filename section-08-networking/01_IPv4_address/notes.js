// IPv4 Address & Submet Mask

//     What is an IP Address?

//         IP stands for Internet Protocol.
//         An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected to a network (like the internet).
//         It is assigned by a router (in local networks) or ISP (in mobile or broadband networks).
//         Note: IP protocol ≠ IP address. The protocol is the set of rules; the address is just a part of it.

//     IPv4 Address Format
//         IPv4 is a 32-bit binary number, grouped into 4 sections of 8 bits (called octets):
//         Example (Binary):  11000000 10101000 00000000 00000001
//                     = 192      .168     .0       .1
//         It's converted to decimal format for human readability:
//         192.168.0.1

//     IPv4 Range
//         Minimum IPv4 Address: 0.0.0.0
//         Maximum IPv4 Address: 255.255.255.255
//         Total Unique IPv4 Addresses: 256^4 = 4,294,967,296

//     Reserved Address Range (Mistake or Limitation of IPv4)
//         127.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255: Reserved for loopback testing (internal testing, like localhost).
//         These addresses are not assigned to any device on the network.
//         Example:
//         127.0.0.1 → Loopback Address
//         Subnet Mask: 255.0.0.0

//     What is a Subnet Mask?
//         A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into:
//             Network portion: Identifies the network.
//             Host portion: Identifies the device on that network.
//         Example:
//         IP Address:    192.168.1.10
//         Subnet Mask:   255.255.255.0
//         Binary:        11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

//     What is CIDR Notation?
//         CIDR stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing.
//         Instead of writing full subnet masks, CIDR uses a shorthand:
//         192.168.1.10/24
//         /24 means the first 24 bits are for the network, and the remaining 8 bits are for hosts.
//         Equivalent Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
