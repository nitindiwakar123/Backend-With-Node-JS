// Understanding Domain Name System (DNS)

//     The Domain Name System (DNS) converts human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.
    
//     Domain Hierarchy

//         Root Level (RLD)
//             Represented by a dot (.)
//             It is the highest level in the DNS hierarchy
//             Managed by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)
//             Contains all Top-Level Domains (TLDs)

//         Top-Level Domain (TLD)
//             Examples: .com, .org, .net, .gov, .in
//             TLDs are owned by organizations that have the authority to manage them
//             These organizations are allowed to create Second-Level Domains

//         Second-Level Domain
//             Example: google in google.com
//             Created under a TLD
//             Ownership of second-level domains is granted by TLD registrars

//         Subdomain
//             Example: www in www.google.com
//             Created under a second-level domain
//             Can be multiple levels deep (e.g., mail.support.google.com)

//     Important Rules
//         The total length of a domain name (including dots) cannot exceed 255 characters.
//         Each label (a part of the domain between dots) can be up to 63 characters long.

//     Domain Registration
//         While TLDs are owned by authorized organizations, they typically do not sell domains directly.
//         Instead, domain registerars (also known as brokers), such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc., handle the sale and management of second-level domains to the public.
