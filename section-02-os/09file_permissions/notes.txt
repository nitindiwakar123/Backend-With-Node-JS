File Permissions in Windows:

File permissions in Windows control who can access, modify, or execute files and folders. Here's a breakdown to help you understand how they work:

🔑 Types of Permissions
Windows uses NTFS (New Technology File System) permissions. There are two levels:

1. Basic Permissions:
These are commonly used and include:

Permission	Description
Full Control - Do anything (read, write, modify, delete, change permissions).
Modify	Read, write, and delete files/folders.

Read & Execute - View and run executable files.
List Folder Contents -	View names of files and subfolders.
Read -	View file content and attributes.
Write -	Modify file content and create new files/folders.

2. Advanced Permissions:
These include more specific controls like:

Traverse folder / execute file

Delete subfolders and files

Change permissions

Take ownership

🔧 How to View or Edit File Permissions
Right-click the file/folder → Click Properties

Go to the Security tab

Click Edit to change permissions

Use Add / Remove / Edit for specific users or groups

Click Advanced for detailed control

👥 Who Can Have Permissions
Users (e.g., you, another account)

Groups (e.g., Administrators, Everyone)

Permissions can be inherited from the parent folder or explicitly set.

⚠️ Common Terms
Owner: Has full control and can change permissions.

Inherited Permissions: Passed down from parent folder.

Effective Permissions: The actual result of combined permissions from user + group + inheritance.

✅ Tips
Use "Effective Access" in Advanced settings to see what permissions a user actually has.

Be careful with "Deny" – it overrides all Allow permissions.

If you're locked out of a file, you might need to take ownership first.
